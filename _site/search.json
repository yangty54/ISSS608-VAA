The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards. The local council of the city is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received."

Here are some key observations:\n\nThe mean joviality levels are relatively consistent across the age groups, ranging from approximately 0.440 to 0.516.\nThe median joviality levels show a similar pattern, with values ranging from around 0.429 to 0.521.\nThe minimum and maximum joviality levels vary within each age group, indicating the range of joviality experienced by individuals in each group.\nOverall, there doesn’t seem to be a clear trend or pattern in joviality levels across age groups based on these summary statistics.\n\n\n\nHousehold Size and Education Level\n\n# Bar plot for household size and education level\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = householdSize, fill = educationLevel)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(title = \"Household Size by Education Level\", x = \"Household Size\", y = \"Count\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Education Level\")\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above, it appears that the majority of households in the dataset have a household size of 1 or 2. Additionally, the “High School or College” education level seems to be the most prevalent across all household sizes.\nThis suggests a possible correlation between household size and education level. It is likely that individuals living alone or in smaller households (size 1 or 2) are more likely to have completed high school or attended college, as reflected by the higher count in the “High School or College” category for these household sizes.\nOn the other hand, larger household sizes (beyond size 2) may include a mix of different education levels, as evidenced by the presence of “Bachelors” and “Graduate” categories in these groups. This suggests a less diversity of education levels within larger households.\n\n\nEducation Level and Joviality\n\n# Box plot for education level and joviality\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = educationLevel, y = joviality)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Joviality by Education Level\", x = \"Education Level\", y = \"Joviality\")\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results, we can make a scientific guess that individuals with higher education levels, such as “Graduate” and “Bachelors,” tend to have higher median joviality scores compared to those with lower education levels, such as “Low” and “High School or College.” Additionally, individuals with higher education levels generally have a wider range of joviality values, as indicated by the larger differences between the minimum and maximum joviality values.\n\n\nInterest Group and Joviality\n\n# Box plot for interest group and joviality\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = interestGroup, y = joviality)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Joviality by Interest Group\", x = \"Interest Group\", y = \"Joviality\")\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results, we can make a scientific guess that different interest groups may have varying levels of median joviality. For example, “Group E” and “Group B” have relatively higher median joviality compared to “Group H” and “Group D.” However, it’s important to note that there could be other factors influencing joviality, and this analysis only considers the provided data.\n\n\nHousehold Size and Amount\n\n# Scatter plot for household size and amount\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = as.factor(householdSize), y = amount, fill = as.factor(householdSize))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\", fun = \"mean\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Amount by Household Size\", x = \"Household Size\", y = \"Mean Amount\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Household Size\")\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results, we can make a scientific analysis that households with larger sizes tend to have slightly higher mean amounts compared to smaller households. However, it’s important to note that the median amount is the same for all household sizes, suggesting a similar distribution of amounts regardless of household size.\nAdditionally, the range of amounts spent varies across different household sizes, as indicated by the differences in the minimum and maximum amounts. This implies that there might be variations in spending habits and financial situations among households of different sizes.\n\n\nEducation Level and Amount\n\n# Box plot for education level and amount\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = educationLevel, y = amount, fill = educationLevel)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(color = educationLevel), width = 0.2, height = 0, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Amount by Education Level\", x = \"Education Level\", y = \"Amount\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Education Level\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Education Level\")\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results, we can make a scientific analysis that individuals with higher education levels, such as “Graduate” and “Bachelors,” tend to have higher maximum amounts spent compared to those with lower education levels, such as “Low” and “High School or College.”\nThe data reveals that within each education level group, there are individuals who have higher amounts spent or higher income compared to others in the same group. This suggests that being successful is always a possibility, regardless of education level, as personal circumstances, career choices, skills, networking, and opportunities also play a significant role.Education level is an important factor that can contribute to success and income, but it is not the sole determinant. Education provides knowledge and opportunities, but it does not guarantee automatic financial prosperity.

Additionally, the highest mean spending in the “Shelter” category suggests that individuals with a Graduate degree allocate a significant portion of their expenses towards their living arrangements.\nFor individuals with a Bachelor’s degree, the “RentAdjustment” category tends to have the highest mean amount compared to other expense categories. This indicates that individuals with a high level of education, such as a Bachelor’s degree, allocate a larger proportion of their expenses towards adjusting their rent.\nOn the other hand, for individuals with a low education level, the mean spending on shelter is the lowest among all groups. This implies that individuals with lower education levels tend to allocate less money towards their living environment or housing expenses. In other words, lower education levels may play a role in determining lower spending on shelter, indicating potential differences in financial capabilities and living conditions based on educational attainment.\n\n\nInterest Group and Expense Category\n\n# Bar plot for interest group and expense category (mean values)\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = interestGroup, fill = category)) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = amount, group = category), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"bar\") +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Expense Category by Interest Group\", x = \"Interest Group\", y = \"Mean Count\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Expense Category\")\n\n\n\n\nFor interest groups E, G, and I, the mean count for the “RentAdjustment” category appears to be relatively low compared to other interest groups. This suggests that individuals in these groups, on average, spend less on adjusting their rent compared to individuals in other interest groups.\nConversely, interest group H shows a significant difference in renting behavior. The mean count for the “RentAdjustment” category is notably higher in group H compared to other interest groups. This indicates that individuals in interest group H, on average, allocate a larger portion of their expenses towards adjusting their rent.\nFor other expense categories, such as “Education,” “Food,” “Recreation,” and others, there are no significant differences observed across the interest groups. The mean counts for these categories appear to be relatively similar, suggesting that individuals in different interest groups have comparable spending patterns in these areas."

The plot allows us to identify any patterns, trends, or fluctuations in joviality over time, and how they might differ across the various demographic groups.\nBy combining the timestamp, joviality, education level, household size, and interest group in an interactive and animated visualization, we can gain insights into the dynamics of joviality within different segments of the population and explore any potential relationships or correlations between these variables."

The green line represents food expenses, specifically highlighting the trend in spending on food items. By comparing the two lines, we can observe how food expenses contribute to the overall expenses and whether there are any notable patterns or fluctuations.\nThe visualization shows the distribution of expenses over time, with a specific focus on the food category. It is evident that food expenses constitute a relatively small portion of the overall expenses. This observation suggests that individuals in the town allocate a smaller proportion of their budget towards food compared to other expenditure categories."
