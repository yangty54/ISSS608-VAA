In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\nCombining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“|” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“/” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\nCreating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np12 <- p1|p2\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'"

Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\nDisplaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying statistics on tooltip\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip <- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {\n  mean <- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem <- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\ngg_point <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  \n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  \n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  \n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover effect with data_id aesthetic\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             \n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyling hover effect\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining tooltip and hover effect\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, \n        data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick effect with onclick\nonclick argument of ggiraph provides hotlink interactivity on the web.\nThe code chunk below shown an example of onclick.\n\nexam_data$onclick <- sprintf(\"window.open(\\\"%s%s\\\")\",\n\"https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Primary%20school\",\nas.character(exam_data$ID))\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(onclick = onclick),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinated Multiple Views with ggiraph\nCoordinated multiple views methods has been implemented in the data visualisation below.\nNotice that when a data point of one of the dotplot is selected, the corresponding data point ID on the second data visualisation will be highlighted too.\nIn order to build a coordinated multiple views as shown in the example above, the following programming strategy will be used:\n\nAppropriate interactive functions of ggiraph will be used to create the multiple views.\npatchwork function of patchwork package will be used inside girafe function to create the interactive coordinated multiple views.\n\n\np1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = ID),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\np2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = ID),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(code = print(p1 + p2), \n       width_svg = 6,\n       height_svg = 3,\n       options = list(\n         opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),\n         opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\")\n         )\n       ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe data_id aesthetic is critical to link observations between plots and the tooltip aesthetic is optional but nice to have when mouse over a point."

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it's important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning."
