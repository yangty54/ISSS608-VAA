<h1>Setting the Scene</h1>
<p>City of Engagement, with a total population of 50,000, is a small city located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards. The local council of the city is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.</p>

<p>Next, I will perform categorical variable standardization, the levels of categorical variables like “educationLevel” or “interestGroup” might inconsistent capitalization or spelling, I decided to use functions like <strong><code>tolower()</code></strong> or <strong><code>recode()</code></strong> from the <strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> to standarde them for consistency and easier analysis.</p>

<p>For the Age, the distribution seems very rather smooth with no clear peak or hump of a group age, it jumps up and down in between ages with no concentrated point.</p>
<p>For the Education level, people who have high school or college level appears to be most common.</p>

<p>For the amount, as it concentrated towards the 0, it means the amount of transactions are mostly small.</p>
<p>For the Expense category, the transaction categories are mostly on food, recreation, and wages.</p>
<p>For the total amount spent per month, except for before April 2022, all other time spam seems quite smooth with transaction amount.</p>

<p>Based on the summary statistics for the age groups and joviality, we can interpret the results as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Age Group “18-25”:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mean Joviality: 0.511</p></li>
<li><p>Median Joviality: 0.503</p></li>

<p>These statistics provide an overview of the joviality levels within each age group. Here are some key observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The mean joviality levels are relatively consistent across the age groups, ranging from approximately 0.440 to 0.516.</p></li>
<li><p>The median joviality levels show a similar pattern, with values ranging from around 0.429 to 0.521.</p></li>
<li><p>The minimum and maximum joviality levels vary within each age group, indicating the range of joviality experienced by individuals in each group.</p></li>
<li><p>Overall, there doesn’t seem to be a clear trend or pattern in joviality levels across age groups based on these summary statistics.</p></li>

<p>From the plot above, it appears that the majority of households in the dataset have a household size of 1 or 2. Additionally, the “High School or College” education level seems to be the most prevalent across all household sizes.</p>
<p>This suggests a possible correlation between household size and education level. It is likely that individuals living alone or in smaller households (size 1 or 2) are more likely to have completed high school or attended college, as reflected by the higher count in the “High School or College” category for these household sizes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, larger household sizes (beyond size 2) may include a mix of different education levels, as evidenced by the presence of “Bachelors” and “Graduate” categories in these groups. This suggests a less diversity of education levels within larger households.</p>

<p>Based on these results, we can make a scientific guess that individuals with higher education levels, such as “Graduate” and “Bachelors,” tend to have higher median joviality scores compared to those with lower education levels, such as “Low” and “High School or College.” Additionally, individuals with higher education levels generally have a wider range of joviality values, as indicated by the larger differences between the minimum and maximum joviality values.</p>

<p>Based on these results, we can make a scientific guess that different interest groups may have varying levels of median joviality. For example, “Group E” and “Group B” have relatively higher median joviality compared to “Group H” and “Group D.” However, it’s important to note that there could be other factors influencing joviality, and this analysis only considers the provided data.</p>

<p>Based on these results, we can make a scientific analysis that households with larger sizes tend to have slightly higher mean amounts compared to smaller households. However, it’s important to note that the median amount is the same for all household sizes, suggesting a similar distribution of amounts regardless of household size.</p>
<p>Additionally, the range of amounts spent varies across different household sizes, as indicated by the differences in the minimum and maximum amounts. This implies that there might be variations in spending habits and financial situations among households of different sizes.</p>

<p>Based on these results, we can make a scientific analysis that individuals with higher education levels, such as “Graduate” and “Bachelors,” tend to have higher maximum amounts spent compared to those with lower education levels, such as “Low” and “High School or College.”</p>
<p>The data reveals that within each education level group, there are individuals who have higher amounts spent or higher income compared to others in the same group. This suggests that being successful is always a possibility, regardless of education level, as personal circumstances, career choices, skills, networking, and opportunities also play a significant role.Education level is an important factor that can contribute to success and income, but it is not the sole determinant. Education provides knowledge and opportunities, but it does not guarantee automatic financial prosperity. Success is multifaceted and influenced by various factors beyond education alone.</p>

<p>For the age group and the expenses plot, it appears to have a similar pattern with the previous two plots. While distinct classes are found, indicates age might not be de determinant factor of different class.</p>
<p>Analyzing the relationship between age group and financial outcomes is complex and multidimensional. It requires considering a broader range of variables and conducting more in-depth statistical analyses to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing success and income.</p>

<p>For individuals with a Graduate level of education, the mean amount spent on wages appears to be the highest among all expense categories. Additionally, the highest mean spending in the “Shelter” category suggests that individuals with a Graduate degree allocate a significant portion of their expenses towards their living arrangements.</p>
<p>For individuals with a Bachelor’s degree, the “RentAdjustment” category tends to have the highest mean amount compared to other expense categories. This indicates that individuals with a high level of education, such as a Bachelor’s degree, allocate a larger proportion of their expenses towards adjusting their rent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for individuals with a low education level, the mean spending on shelter is the lowest among all groups. This implies that individuals with lower education levels tend to allocate less money towards their living environment or housing expenses. In other words, lower education levels may play a role in determining lower spending on shelter, indicating potential differences in financial capabilities and living conditions based on educational attainment.</p>

<p>For interest groups E, G, and I, the mean count for the “RentAdjustment” category appears to be relatively low compared to other interest groups. This suggests that individuals in these groups, on average, spend less on adjusting their rent compared to individuals in other interest groups.</p>
<p>Conversely, interest group H shows a significant difference in renting behavior. The mean count for the “RentAdjustment” category is notably higher in group H compared to other interest groups. This indicates that individuals in interest group H, on average, allocate a larger portion of their expenses towards adjusting their rent.</p>
<p>For other expense categories, such as “Education,” “Food,” “Recreation,” and others, there are no significant differences observed across the interest groups. The mean counts for these categories appear to be relatively similar, suggesting that individuals in different interest groups have comparable spending patterns in these areas.</p>

<p>The animated line chart shows the moving average of joviality over time, with separate lines for each education level. The animation creates a dynamic view of how the moving average of joviality changes over time for each education level.</p>
<p>A moving average smooths out short-term fluctuations and highlights longer-term trends in the data. In this case, we use a window of 10 data points for calculating the moving average. The moving average of joviality for each education level is calculated at each timestamp within the given window.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief interpretation of the plot:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>X-axis (Timestamp): Represents the time variable, showing the progression of the data over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Y-axis (Moving Average Joviality): Represents the moving average of joviality calculated for each education level at each timestamp. The moving average smooths out the short-term fluctuations in joviality and highlights the overall trend.</p></li>
<li><p>Color-coded lines (Education Level): Each line in the plot represents a different education level. The color-coding allows you to easily distinguish between the education levels and observe their trends in joviality over time.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the animation, the “Graduate” group consistently shows higher moving average joviality compared to the other groups, while the “High school and college” group consistently shows lower moving average joviality. This observation suggests that there is a noticeable difference in joviality between these two education levels.</p>
<p>The animated line chart reveals that although there is no significant overall increase or decrease in joviality across different education levels, there are numerous fluctuations along the way. This observation implies that people’s happiness or joviality is subject to constant change.</p>

<p>This plot displays the trends in expenses and food expenses over a specific time period. The x-axis represents the date, while the y-axis represents the amount of expenses. The plot includes two lines: one representing total expenses and the other representing food expenses.</p>
<p>The blue line represents the total expenses, showing the overall trend in expenses over time. The green line represents food expenses, specifically highlighting the trend in spending on food items. By comparing the two lines, we can observe how food expenses contribute to the overall expenses and whether there are any notable patterns or fluctuations.</p>
<p>The visualization shows the distribution of expenses over time, with a specific focus on the food category. It is evident that food expenses constitute a relatively small portion of the overall expenses. This observation suggests that individuals in the town allocate a smaller proportion of their budget towards food compared to other expenditure categories.</p>

<section id="cluster-analysis" class="level1">
<h1>Cluster Analysis</h1>
<p>This section focuses on identifying distinct groups or clusters within the dataset based on similarities in the selected variables. This analysis helps uncover hidden patterns or structures in the data by grouping similar observations together and highlighting their shared characteristics. By applying clustering algorithms, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, the data is partitioned into clusters, with each cluster representing a distinct segment or subgroup within the population. The cluster analysis provides valuable insights into the heterogeneity within the data and can be used for segmentation, profiling, or targeted strategies. By understanding the unique characteristics and behaviors of each cluster, decision-makers can tailor their approaches and interventions to specific groups, leading to more effective decision-making and resource allocation.</p>
<section id="age-household-size-and-spending-amount" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="age-household-size-and-spending-amount">Age, Household Size, and Spending Amount</h2>
<p>K-means clustering was chosen as the method for analyzing the variables age, household size, and spending amount. This approach provides a straightforward and efficient way to identify distinct groups based on similarities in these variables. By clustering individuals based on age, we can explore if there are any age-related patterns in household size and spending amount. The clustering of household size allows us to examine if different household sizes exhibit unique spending behaviors. Additionally, clustering individuals based on spending amount helps identify distinct spending profiles or segments within the population. Overall, the application of k-means clustering on age, household size, and spending amount enables us to uncover underlying patterns and relationships, assisting in targeted decision-making and strategy development based on different age groups, household sizes, and spending patterns.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="age-household-size-joviality-and-education-level">Age, Household Size, Joviality and Education Level</h2>
<p>The fanny algorithm was selected for analyzing the variables of age, household size, joviality, and education level. Fanny, a variant of k-means clustering, is particularly suitable for categorical variables such as education level. By incorporating education level as a categorical variable, we can explore the relationship between demographic factors (age and household size) and psychological well-being (joviality) within different educational groups. Fanny algorithm allows for a more flexible clustering approach by accommodating mixed variable types, enabling us to uncover distinct clusters based on these diverse dimensions. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of how age, household size, joviality, and education level interrelate, allowing for targeted interventions and tailored strategies to address specific needs within different demographic and educational segments of the population.</p>
<p>Given the high computational requirements of cluster analysis, a subsample of 5000 observations was chosen to expedite the analysis process. By working with a smaller subset, the computational time was significantly reduced while still allowing for meaningful insights. It is important to note that the subsample should be representative of the larger dataset, capturing its key characteristics and variability. The use of a subsample should be clearly documented and acknowledged to ensure transparency in the analysis.</p>

Similar to the other clusters, the majority of individuals in this cluster have a high school or college education level.</p>
<p>This group might include younger individuals with slightly larger households but lower joviality levels. They could be in a stage of life where they are starting families or building their careers. Their lower level of joviality might be influenced by the challenges and responsibilities they face as they transition into adulthood.</p>
<p>Cluster 4:</p>
<p>Mean Age: 38.31</p>
<p>Mean Household Size: 3.00</p>
<p>Mean Joviality: 0.477</p>
<p>Mean Education Level: High School or College</p>
<p>Cluster 4: This cluster consists of individuals with a mean age of 38.31 and larger household sizes of 3.00. They have a moderate level of joviality with a mean of 0.477. Similar to other clusters, the majority of individuals in this cluster have a high school or college education level.</p>
<p>This group might represent individuals with larger families who tend to be moderately jovial. They could be in a stage of life where they are actively managing their family life, balancing multiple responsibilities, and engaging in social interactions. Their moderate level of joviality might be influenced by their family dynamics and social connections.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, the analysis of the data has provided valuable insights for the city’s community revitalization efforts and the allocation of the city renewal grant. The cluster analysis revealed distinct groups within the population based on age, household size, education level, and spending behavior. These findings shed light on various aspects of the community and can inform strategic resource allocation and decision-making processes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Age Group: The age group of 46-55 appears to have lower joviality compared to other age groups. This finding suggests that individuals in this age range might exhibit a lower level of happiness or cheerfulness, which could be influenced by various factors such as life circumstances or personal experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>Household Size and Education Level: The proportion of individuals with a “low” education level is higher among those living in households with a size of 1. This observation indicates that smaller households are more likely to have individuals with a lower level of education. This relationship could be influenced by factors such as individual preferences, financial constraints, or life circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>Education Level and Joviality: Individuals with a “low” education level exhibit a lower median joviality level. This finding suggests a potential association between education level and emotional well-being, indicating that individuals with lower education levels might experience lower levels of joviality on average. However, it’s important to consider that individual differences and external factors may also contribute to variations in joviality levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Education Level and Spending on Recreation: Individuals with a bachelor’s level of education tend to spend more on recreation activities. This finding suggests that higher education levels might be associated with a greater interest in leisure and recreational pursuits. This could be influenced by factors such as higher disposable income, access to educational opportunities that promote recreational interests, or personal preferences.</p></li>
<li><p>Education Level and Maximum Spending Amount: Individuals with a graduate-level education exhibit a higher maximum spending amount. This finding indicates that individuals with higher education levels might have higher earning potentials or financial resources, allowing them to engage in higher levels of spending. This could be influenced by factors such as career advancements, higher-paying job opportunities, or greater financial stability associated with higher education levels.</p></li>
<li><p>K-means analysis: We identified three distinct clusters. Cluster 1 consists of individuals with a relatively younger age (mean age: 34.53) and moderate household size (mean household size: 2.61). However, they exhibit a negative mean spending amount (-2.13), indicating potential financial challenges. Cluster 2 represents a slightly older group (mean age: 40.43) with a similar household size (mean household size: 2.20), but they display a significantly higher mean spending amount (212.26). This suggests that they may have higher disposable income or engage in higher-value transactions. Cluster 3 represents a relatively older group (mean age: 42.71) with a smaller household size (mean household size: 1.26) and a modest mean spending amount (6.49).</p></li>
<li><p>Fanny analysis: We identified four distinct clusters. Cluster 1 consists of younger individuals (mean age: 30.57) with a moderate household size (mean household size: 1.51) and relatively high joviality (mean joviality: 0.80). The majority of individuals in this cluster have a high school or college education level. Cluster 2 represents an older group (mean age: 51.67) with a similar household size (mean household size: 1.47) but lower joviality (mean joviality: 0.46). Cluster 3 consists of younger individuals (mean age: 30.06) with a slightly larger household size (mean household size: 1.56) and lower joviality (mean joviality: 0.25). Cluster 4 represents individuals with a moderate age (mean age: 38.31), larger household size (mean household size: 3.00), and moderate joviality (mean joviality: 0.48). The majority of individuals in all clusters have a high school or college education level.These findings provide actionable insights for the city’s decision-makers, enabling them to develop targeted programs and interventions that address the specific needs and preferences of different segments of the population. By leveraging these insights, the city can make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources, ensuring that the community’s needs are effectively addressed and that the city renewal grant is utilized for maximum impact.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The analysis of the data has provided valuable insights into the community’s demographics, spending behavior, and educational levels, revealing distinct patterns and associations. These findings have shed light on various aspects of the community and highlighted areas where targeted interventions and resource allocation can make a meaningful impact. Based on these findings, several actionable recommendations emerge.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Targeted Support for Age Group with Lower Joviality: Develop programs and initiatives that promote emotional well-being and enhance the joviality of the age group (46-55) exhibiting lower levels of happiness. This could include mental health support, social engagement activities, or community events aimed at fostering a sense of joy and contentment.</p></li>
<li><p>Educational Opportunities for Smaller Households and Lower Education Levels: Allocate resources to provide educational opportunities, vocational training, or skill development programs for individuals living in smaller households and those with lower education levels. This can empower them with knowledge and skills, enhancing their employability and long-term prospects.</p></li>
<li><p>Investment in Recreational Facilities and Activities: Direct resources towards the development of recreational facilities, community centers, parks, and cultural programs that cater to the interests and preferences of individuals with bachelor’s degrees. This can provide them with enriching leisure experiences and promote a vibrant community life.</p></li>
<li><p>Support Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment for Graduate-Level Individuals: Allocate resources to support entrepreneurship programs, mentorship initiatives, and business development opportunities for individuals with graduate-level education. This can stimulate economic growth, job creation, and innovation within the community.</p></li>
<li><p>Tailored Financial and Business Support for Different Clusters: Provide targeted financial and business support to different clusters based on their characteristics. For example, Cluster 1, consisting of younger individuals with moderate household size, could benefit from financial literacy programs and entrepreneurship training. Cluster 2, with older individuals and higher spending amounts, might benefit from financial planning and retirement savings initiatives. Cluster 3, with a larger household size, could benefit from support programs for family finances and budgeting. Cluster 4, with a moderate household size and joviality, could benefit from programs that enhance financial management skills and promote savings.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboration and Partnerships: Foster collaborations and partnerships with local educational institutions, community organizations, and businesses to leverage their expertise, resources, and networks. This can enhance the effectiveness of resource allocation efforts and create synergies for community revitalization.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At the end, the comprehensive analysis of the data, including exploratory data analysis, interactive visualizations, and cluster analysis, has provided valuable insights for the city’s community revitalization efforts and the allocation of the city renewal grant. By uncovering distinct demographic groups, spending behavior patterns, and educational associations, we have gained a deeper understanding of the community’s needs, preferences, and potential areas of improvement. Through the implementation of targeted actions, such as supporting specific age groups, promoting educational opportunities, investing in recreational facilities, and fostering entrepreneurship, the city can harness these insights to drive positive change and create a vibrant and inclusive community. The findings from this analysis, coupled with the proposed actions, form a solid foundation for strategic decision-making and resource allocation, positioning the city for a successful and impactful community revitalization journey.</p>
